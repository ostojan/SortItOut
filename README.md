# Look At My Data

## About

This repository contains source code showing generic approach to creation of user selectable sort order menu in `SwiftUI` with `SwiftData` background.
Solution presented here can also be easily modified to work with other persistent data backends.

It's a code for article I wrote for my dev blog that you can find [here](https://ostojan.hashnode.dev/sort-it-out).
